My memory for papers is terrible

## Pick a code

Choose some code that you can remember. Careful because if you can't remember papers you won't remember the code you pick.

## Add a paper

You can add papers to Leitner and it will store them in a database according to your code.

## Re-visit

Every time you revisit Leitner it will load up the papers you stored and ask you to do a matching task (match the summary to the paper). If you get it right it doubles the amount of time before it shows you that particular paper again.

## Profit!
