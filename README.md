My memory for papers is terrible

## Login

Create a login/password or register a new one. Your papers are unique to your login name.

## Add a paper

You can add papers to Leitner and it will store them in a database according to your code. Papers you add are put on a 12 hour timer.

## Bins

Each time you revisit Leitner it loads papers whose timers have elapsed, and asks you to do a matching task against two other random "blurbs". If you match correctly the timer increases, if you get it wrong the timer decreases. The timers are:

0.5 days
1 days
4 days
16 days
32 days (when you have >32 cards)
64 days (when you have >64 cards)

## Re-visit

Visit Leitner every morning before you go to work and memorize those papers!
